% NOTE:
% A Cavitation Check is the is incorporated in the code. It further
% prevents plotting for possible but physically unlikely case of expansion
% shocks. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INPUT VARIABLES: 
% Problem definition: Conditions at time t=0
%   rho1, u1, p1
%   rho4, u4, p4
% 'tEnd' and 'n' are the final solution time and the gas DoFs.
